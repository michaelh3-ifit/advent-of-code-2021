# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Executing
To execute a problem run the following command

`yarn && yarn start [dayandpart]`

Where the day and part is represented by number of the day and `a` or `b` for the part. I.e. `1a`, `6b`, etc.

Project format/index was inspired/stolen from [MikeTheReader](https://github.com/MikeTheReader/2020-advent-of-code).
